            <h1 class="py-1">Enhanced Testing Strategy Overview</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                In our endeavor with Microsoft PowerApps, we encounter a distinctive challenge: the platform's <span class="text-warning">lack of traditional coding structure</span> means conventional testing strategies 
                such as code coverage, integration tests, and performance evaluations are not directly applicable. Originally, we believed this limitation would necessitate a sole reliance on 
                extensive user testing, where gathering detailed feedback and insights from end-users stands at the forefront of our efforts to refine the appâ€™s functionality and user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                However, upon further exploration, we discovered that <span class="text-warning">PowerApps Test Studio</span> enables us to conduct Unit Tests despite the platform's code-less environment. 
                This revelation allows us to adopt a <span class="text-warning">dual-faceted testing strategy</span>, combining both <span class="text-warning">Unit Tests</span> and <span class="text-warning">User Acceptance Tests</span>. 
                With Power Apps Test Studio, we can systematically validate individual components of our application, ensuring each function performs as intended in isolation. 
                This is complemented by our user acceptance testing, where real-world application use provides critical feedback on the app's overall performance and usability.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                By integrating Unit Tests with User Acceptance Testing, our strategy now encompasses both <span class="text-warning">technical precision</span> and <span class="text-warning">user-centric evaluation</span>. 
                This comprehensive approach enables us to not only fine-tune the app at a granular level but also to assess its impact and effectiveness from the users' perspective, 
                ensuring a robust and intuitive final product.

        <div class="container p-5">
            <h1 class="py-1">Unit Testing Acceptance Testing Methodology</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Unit tests play a critical role in the software development lifecycle by <span class="text-warning">validating the functionality</span> of 
                individual components or units of code in isolation from the rest of the application. This focus on testing small parts of an application 
                ensures that each component performs as expected.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                <span class="text-warning">Power Apps Test Studio</span> is a low-code solution to write, organize, and automate tests for canvas apps. In Test Studio, 
                tests can be written using Power Apps expressions then played within the Test Studio to validate app functionality. Tests can also be run in a 
                web browser and build the automated tests into the app deployment process.

            <h1 class="py-1">User Acceptance Testing Methodology</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                Our User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase is designed to provide deep insights into the app's performance from the <span class="text-warning">perspective of actual users</span>. 
                To accomplish this, we engaged with our esteemed client, Chanel Fashion, to conduct a thorough evaluation of the app within a real-world context. 
                We selected <span class="text-warning">four testers</span> from Chanel Fashion boutiques, each representing different roles within the organization, to ensure a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. 
                This selection criteria ensure that our testing phase benefits from a broad spectrum of user interactions, highlighting the app's versatility across various operational scenarios.
