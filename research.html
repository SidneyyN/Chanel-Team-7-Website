                As part of the research we did for our app, we looked into existing solutions that solve a similar problem to the one we are looking to fix. 
                During our research we noted that it was hard to find details about bespoke systems catered to a single company’s needs, 
                especially not one as exclusive as Chanel. 
                Therefore, we broke down the problem and looked into distinct examples in order to form a bigger picture. 
                We found some examples and analysed their features to see what we could take inspiration from and what didn’t fit the customised solution we are building.

            <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 10.05.23 AM.png" class="img-fluid p-5 w-100 d-none d-sm-block" alt="">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture platform is a cloud-based workplace operations management tool that helps companies across a variety of sectors digitalise processes, 
                reporting procedures, task management and training, among other features (Safety Culture, 2024).  
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                It is designed to encourage accountability and accurate reporting of both incidents and completed tasks. Whilst this application is designed with higher risk scenarios in mind, 
                such as an environment with moving machinery where health and safety checks must be carried out regularly, its emphasis on rigour and attention to detail is in line with the high standards expected at Chanel. 
                On top of basic features such as checklists and forms, users can add photographic evidence, send notifications to relevant people and flag certain points as requiring action. 
                All modifications by users are time-stamped, auto-saved and backed up so that data is always accessible. These features would be beneficial for us to include as they aid communication between employees and minimalise the margin for error.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Additionally, the platform allows for reviewing of analytics such as the percentage of tasks at various stages (Safety Culture, 2024). Whilst not a crucial feature for us to include in our solution, 
                this could be something useful for us to consider to help stockroom managers visualise overall workload at a glance. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture distinguishes between a variety of different forms for different purposes such as inspections, actions and issues. 
                The distinction is not entirely clear, however our solution would only need one form to hold all information regarding a singular shipment.

            <h2>What we can learn from this project</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                This platform is available on both desktop and mobile, via the iAuditor app. This cross-platform compatibility is also how 
                we hope to implement our solution. Looking into SafetyCulture helped us get some ideas on what layouts are optimal for the 
                different platforms and which features should be highlighted on each. For instance, QR code scanning will only be used on mobile 
                and should therefore be highlighted to mobile users, but employees are less likely to be looking into analytics whilst they are moving around 
                the boutique with their work mobiles, therefore they could be placed somewhere on the main page of the desktop dashboard instead.

            <h1>SimplyDynamics: Interface Courier</h1>
            <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 10.30.25 AM.png" alt="" class="img-fluid p-5 w-100 d-none d-sm-block">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                The SD Interface Courier App is designed to streamline and automate the process of managing shipments for businesses. 
                Integrated directly with the Business Central client, it offers a seamless experience for booking couriers with just one click (Dynamic Shop, 2024). 
                This efficiency extends to the automatic retrieval of labels and parcel tracking codes, 
                ensuring that businesses can easily track their shipments and manage costs effectively. 
                Additionally, the app supports automatic notifications to clients throughout the shipping cycle, 
                enhancing the customer experience by keeping them informed.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                The app boasts an existing direct interface with well-known couriers like DHL, DPD, and GLS, saving employees from needing to manually input 
                tracing information and automating the process of sending updates to clients. There is also a manual option for non-integrated couriers (Dynamic Shop, 2024). 
                However, for us, this automated system does not fit our requirements. 
                Chanel values a personalised customer experience, preferring direct communication between their Fashion Advisors (FAs) and clients. 
                Additionally, within the scope of this project we will likely not be able to link with Chanel's POS to automatically upload order details. 
                As a result, we are not able to use this feature in our app. Fashion Advisors will manually paste tracking links into the app and reach out to clients themselves, 
                maintaining the bespoke customer experience Chanel is prized for.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Another significant aspect of the SD Interface Courier App is its cross-platform compatibility, with a particular emphasis on its desktop version (Dynamic Shop, 2021). 
                The app's desktop layout is noted for being exceptionally user-friendly and flexible, allowing users to switch between states with ease. 
                This aspect is particularly relevant to us as creating a desktop version of our app is a "Should-have" requirement on our MOSCOW list. 
                We see value in drawing inspiration from the SD Interface Courier Desktop App's design to enhance our own app's user experience.
            </p>
            <h2>What we can learn from this project</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                While the SD Interface Courier App offers comprehensive features for automating and managing shipping processes efficiently, its functionalities do not offer much to us. 
                By focusing on personalising the shipping notification process and drawing inspiration from the app's user-friendly desktop layout, 
                we can enhance our own app to better meet Chanel's high standards for customer service and operational efficiency. 
                For example the table layout that would not be user-friendly on mobile but allows for easily viewing a large amount of data at a glance when using a bigger screen would be something that we can learn from.
