                As part of the research we did for our app, we looked into existing solutions that solve a similar problem to the one we are looking to fix. 
                During our research we noted that it was hard to find details about bespoke systems catered to a single company’s needs, 
                especially not one as exclusive as Chanel. 
                Therefore, we broke down the problem and looked into distinct examples in order to form a bigger picture. 
                We found some examples and analysed their features to see what we could take inspiration from and what didn’t fit the customised solution we are building.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture platform is a cloud-based workplace operations management tool that helps companies across a variety of sectors digitalise processes, 
                reporting procedures, task management and training, among other features.  
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                It is designed to encourage accountability and accurate reporting of both incidents and completed tasks. Whilst this application is designed with higher risk scenarios in mind, 
                such as an environment with moving machinery where health and safety checks must be carried out regularly, its emphasis on rigour and attention to detail is in line with the high standards expected at Chanel. 
                On top of basic features such as checklists and forms, users can add photographic evidence, send notifications to relevant people and flag certain points as requiring action. 
                All modifications by users are time-stamped, auto-saved and backed up so that data is always accessible. These features would be beneficial for us to include as they aid communication between employees and minimalism the margin for error.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Additionally, the platform allows for reviewing of analytics such as the percentage of tasks at various stages. Whilst not a crucial feature for us to include in our solution, 
                this could be something useful for us to consider to help stockroom managers visualise overall boutique progress at a glance. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture distinguishes between a variety of different forms for different purposes such as inspections, actions and issues. 
                The distinction is not entirely clear, however our solution would only need one form to hold all information regarding a singular shipment.

            <h2>What we can learn from this project</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                This platform is available on both desktop and mobile, via the iAuditor app. This cross-platform compatibility is also how 
                we hope to implement our solution. Looking into SafetyCulture helped us get some ideas on what layouts are optimal for the 
                different platforms and which features should be highlighted on each. For instance, QR code scanning will only be used on mobile 
                and should therefore be highlighted to mobile users, but employees are less likely to be looking into analytics whilst they are moving around 
                the boutique with their work mobiles, therefore they could be placed somewhere on the main page of the desktop dashboard.
