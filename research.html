                Our primary objective is to develop a PowerApps application tailored for Chanel, with PowerApps serving as the foundational development platform. 
                Yet, a critical decision remains in selecting an appropriate database solution to support our application's needs. After careful consideration, 
                we have identified <span class="text-warning">SharePoint Lists</span> and <span class="text-warning">Microsoft SQL</span> as our top candidates. The selection process necessitates a thorough comparison across various dimensions, 
                including functionality, efficiency, and ease of integration.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                This article is dedicated to exploring the <span class="text-warning">advantages</span> and <span class="text-warning">disadvantages</span> of both SharePoint Lists and Microsoft SQL. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis that demonstrates why 
                SharePoint Lists emerge as the most fitting and refined choice for our project's requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Beyond choosing a database solution, we looked into <span class="text-warning">existing solutions</span> that solve a similar problem to the one we are looking to fix. During our research we noted that it was hard to find details about 
                bespoke systems catered to a single company’s needs, especially not one as exclusive as Chanel. Therefore, we broke down the problem and looked into distinct examples in order to form a bigger picture. 
                We found some examples and analysed their features to see what we could take inspiration from and what didn’t fit the customised solution we are building.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                The following sections will delve into our findings from researching various PowerApps solutions, aiming to draw valuable insights to inform the development of a solution that not only meets but exceeds Chanel's specific needs.

            <h1 class="py-1">Technology Review</h1>
            <h2 class="py-1">Database Solution</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Selecting a dependable database solution is important for the success of our project. We need a system that is flexible, performs well and is <span class="text-warning">user-friendly</span>. 
                In order to make our decision, we go into a comparative analysis of SharePoint Lists and Microsoft SQL, to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each option against our project's requirements. 
                Through this analysis, we illustrate why SharePoint Lists emerges as the more suitable choice thanks to its <span class="text-warning">functionality</span>, <span class="text-warning">efficiency</span>, and <span class="text-warning">ease of integration</span>.
            </p>
            <h3 class="py-1">Background</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                Sharepoint Lists were introduced into Microsoft SharePoint in 2016, a highly <span class="text-warning">user-friendly interface</span> that mirrors the functionality of Excel spreadsheets, 
                enabling effortless management, updating, and display of data. (BeyondIntranet, 2024) One of SharePoint Lists' notable advantages is its array of ready-to-use <span class="text-warning">templates</span>, which serve as an excellent foundation for organizing list items. (Microsoft Support, 2019) 
                Furthermore, the online nature of SharePoint Lists, which ensures a single version of data exists, eliminates version control issues. (ContentFormula, 2023) This aspect is particularly beneficial, as it streamlines operations and enhances efficiency.
                Conversely, Microsoft SQL is an advanced database solution that leverages Structured Query Language (SQL) as its foundation. Microsoft SQL is described as a feature-rich platform, offering <span class="text-warning">extensive capabilities</span> including granular access control permissions and built-in server roles. (TechTarget, 2024) 
                These features are essential for enforcing the principle of least privilege, ensuring data security. Additionally, Microsoft SQL integrates with Azure Synapse Link for SQL to provide <span class="text-warning">near-real-time analytics</span> on operational data and employs horizontal fusion query execution plan optimization, 
                significantly reducing the number of queries needed to fetch results. The platform's advanced and secure nature, coupled with its comprehensive feature set, makes it an ideal choice for robust business solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                In summary, SharePoint Lists and Microsoft SQL each bring distinct strengths to the table. SharePoint Lists excel in user-friendliness and simplicity, making them ideal for projects requiring quick setup and straightforward data management. On the other hand, 
                Microsoft SQL offers many advanced features and security measures, suited for complex business environments where data analytics and security are a priority.
            </p>
            <h3 class="py-1">Comparison</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                When evaluating the functionality aspect of our database options, Microsoft SQL outperforms SharePoint Lists in terms of the depth of features offered. Its advanced capabilities and heightened security measures are far more advanced, catering well to complex database needs. 
                However, the sophistication of Microsoft SQL <span class="text-warning">surpasses the requirements</span> of our project's relatively straightforward database structure. The extensive functionalities would <span class="text-warning">remain largely unused</span> within the scope of our needs.
                As a result, SharePoint Lists are the more <span class="text-warning">practical</span> choice for our project, particularly when considering efficiency and ease of integration with PowerApps. Its simplicity and user-friendly nature, which mirror Excel's interface, 
                significantly reduce the learning curve and expedite the development process. Moreover, the availability of <span class="text-warning">extensive documentation</span> further enhances SharePoint Lists' appeal, 
                providing valuable resources for troubleshooting. By opting for SharePoint Lists, we leverage a tool that not only meets our current requirements, but does so in an efficient and user-friendly manner, ensuring swift progress and a focus on developing a robust application within the PowerApps ecosystem.

            <h3 class="py-1">Features</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture platform is a cloud-based workplace <span class="text-warning">operations management tool</span> that helps companies across a variety of sectors digitalise processes, 
                reporting procedures, task management and training, among other features (Safety Culture, 2024).  
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                It is designed to encourage accountability and accurate reporting of both incidents and completed tasks. Whilst this application is designed with higher risk scenarios in mind, 
                such as an environment with moving machinery where health and safety checks must be carried out regularly, its emphasis on rigour and attention to detail is in line with the high standards expected at Chanel. 
                On top of basic features such as checklists and forms, users can add <span class="text-warning">photographic evidence</span>, send notifications to relevant people and flag certain points as requiring action. 
                All modifications by users are time-stamped, auto-saved and backed up so that data is always accessible. These features would be beneficial for us to include as they aid communication between employees and minimalise the margin for error.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Additionally, the platform allows for reviewing of analytics such as the percentage of tasks at various stages (Safety Culture, 2024). Whilst not a crucial feature for us to include in our solution, 
                this could be something useful for us to consider to help stockroom managers visualise overall workload at a glance. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                SafetyCulture distinguishes between a variety of different forms for different purposes such as inspections, actions and issues. 
                The distinction is not entirely clear, however our solution would only need one form to hold all information regarding a singular shipment.

            <p class="lead">
                This platform is available on both desktop and mobile, via the iAuditor app. This <span class="text-warning">cross-platform compatibility</span> is also how 
                we hope to implement our solution. Looking into SafetyCulture helped us get some ideas on <span class="text-warning">what layouts are optimal for the different platforms</span>
                and which features should be highlighted on each. For instance, QR code scanning will only be used on mobile 
                and should therefore be highlighted to mobile users, but employees are less likely to be looking into analytics whilst they are moving around 
                the boutique with their work mobiles, therefore they could be placed somewhere on the main page of the desktop dashboard instead.

            <h2>SimplyDynamics: Interface Courier</h2>
            <img src="img/Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 10.30.25 AM.png" alt="" class="img-fluid img-hover-scale p-5 w-100 d-none d-sm-block">
            <h3 class="py-1">Features</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                The SD Interface Courier App is designed to streamline and automate the process of <span class="text-warning">managing shipments for businesses</span>. 
                Integrated directly with the Business Central client, it offers a seamless experience for booking couriers with just one click (Dynamic Shop, 2024). 
                This efficiency extends to the automatic retrieval of labels and parcel tracking codes, 
                ensuring that businesses can easily track their shipments and manage costs effectively. 
                Additionally, the app supports automatic notifications to clients throughout the shipping cycle, 
                enhancing the customer experience by keeping them informed.</p>
            <p class="lead">
                The app boasts an existing direct interface with well-known couriers like DHL, DPD, and GLS, saving employees from needing to manually input 
                tracing information and automating the process of sending updates to clients. There is also a manual option for non-integrated couriers (Dynamic Shop, 2024). 
                However, for us, this automated system does not fit our requirements. 
                Chanel values a personalised customer experience, preferring direct communication between their Fashion Advisors (FAs) and clients. 
                Additionally, within the scope of this project we will likely <span class="text-warning">not be able to link with Chanel's POS</span> to automatically upload order details. 
                As a result, we are not able to use this feature in our app. Fashion Advisors will manually paste tracking links into the app and reach out to clients themselves, 
                maintaining the bespoke customer experience Chanel is prized for.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Another significant aspect of the SD Interface Courier App is its <span class="text-warning">cross-platform compatibility</span>, with a particular emphasis on its desktop version (Dynamic Shop, 2021). 
                The app's desktop layout is noted for being exceptionally user-friendly and flexible, allowing users to switch between states with ease. 
                This aspect is particularly relevant to us as creating a desktop version of our app is a "Should-have" requirement on our MOSCOW list. 
                We see value in drawing inspiration from the SD Interface Courier Desktop App's design to enhance our own app's user experience.
            </p>
            <h3 class="py-1">What we can <span class="text-warning">learn</span> from this project</h3>
            <p class="lead">
                While the SD Interface Courier App offers comprehensive features for automating and managing shipping processes efficiently, its functionalities do not offer much to us. 
                By focusing on personalising the shipping notification process and drawing inspiration from the app's <span class="text-warning">user-friendly desktop layout</span>, 
                we can enhance our own app to better meet Chanel's high standards for customer service and operational efficiency. 
                For example the table layout that would not be user-friendly on mobile but allows for easily viewing a large amount of data at a glance when using a bigger screen would be something that we can learn from.
