            <p class="lead">
                Using PowerApps, which <span class="text-warning">skips traditional coding</span>, we sidestep a lot of common bugs. This doesn't mean our app is perfect — issues can still pop up from setup mistakes or tricky integrations. 
                But without the usual code complications, we're more likely to have a <span class="text-warning">smooth-running app</span>. It let us concentrate on making things work better for users instead of getting bogged down fixing endless bugs.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Therefore we are proud to say that there are no known bugs in our application.

    <!-- Critical Evaluation of the project -->
    <section class="p-5 p-lg-0 pt-lg-t text-center text-sm-start">
        <div class="container p-5">
            <h1 class="py-1">Critical Evaluation of the Project</h1>
            <p class="lead">
              We conduct thorough investigation of the work we have done, and evaluate them for continuous improvements in future projects.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">User Interface and Experience</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Users consistently express the ease of navigating our application, proving that our dedication towards designing an <span class="text-warning">intuitive</span> and <span class="text-warning">straightforward</span> UI has paid off. 
              Given the positive response, we rated ourselves Very Good for our UI work.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Functionality</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              We have successfully delivered a PowerApps application that not only serves our clients' current needs but also offers the flexibility for future enhancements. 
              We have completed <span class="text-warning">89%</span> of all items in our MoSCoW requirements list. Moreover, our team has meticulously <span class="text-warning">tested each functionality</span> within the app to ensure reliability and performance. 
              Given these accomplishments and the thorough validation of our app's features, we assign ourselves a 'Good' rating for functionality completion. 
              This rating reflects our commitment to delivering a robust and comprehensive solution, even as we are aware of areas for future growth and improvement.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Stability</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Our application is particularly stable, due to its foundation built on PowerApps, and reinforced through our extensive unit tests. 
              This rigorous testing process has ensured that our application <span class="text-warning">operates reliably under all conditions</span>. 
              Given the solid performance and the minimal issues encountered during testing, we confidently award ourselves a 'Good' rating for stability.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Efficiency</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              While considering the efficiency of our project, it's important to acknowledge the <span class="text-warning">constraints</span> we have navigated due to the nature of PowerApps. 
              While the platform has enabled us to build and deploy our application effectively, we've occasionally encountered <span class="text-warning">performance slowdowns</span> inherent to the system. 
              There are <span class="text-warning">occasional delays</span> with loading the application on mobile devices. Despite these challenges, our team has worked diligently to optimize performance wherever possible, 
              striving to balance functionality with speed. Therefore, in evaluating our performance in terms of efficiency, we deem it appropriate to assign ourselves an 'Okay' rating.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Compatibility</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              The PowerApps platform that forms our application foundation ensures broad accessibility across various devices. A key strength lies in its <span class="text-warning">universal compatibility</span>; 
              users can effortlessly access our application on any iPhone model, provided they have installed PowerApps from their respective app store. 
              Therefore, our compatibility score deserves a ‘Very Good’ rating.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Maintainability</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              In terms of the maintainability aspect of our project, we've placed a <span class="text-warning">strong emphasis</span> on <span class="text-warning">transparency</span> and <span class="text-warning">comprehensive documentation</span>, 
              ensuring that our clients are well-informed about how our app operates, particularly regarding its integration with SharePoint Lists. 
              Furthermore, we've provided detailed documentation on the other technologies utilized within our application, such as the barcode scanner feature. 
              This level of detail in our documentation facilitates easier updates, troubleshooting, and potential future enhancements by either our team or the client’s <span class="text-warning">in-house developers</span>. 
              Given the thoroughness of our documentation and the effort to inform our clients on the app’s inner workings, we assess our maintainability as 'Good'.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Project Management</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Our project management approach has been methodical and highly effective, warranting a 'Very Good' rating. With a structured schedule of <span class="text-warning">weekly internal meetings</span> among our team of three, 
              we have ensured consistent progress, clear communication, and immediate resolution of any arising issues. Complementing this, our <span class="text-warning">fortnightly meetings with clients</span> have been instrumental in maintaining transparency, 
              sharing progress updates, and incorporating feedback in real-time. This consistent communication strategy has not only fostered a collaborative working environment but has also allowed us to 
              manage expectations and adapt swiftly to client needs. The result is a well-coordinated project that has stayed on track, met deadlines, and maintained high levels of client satisfaction throughout its development phase.

    <!-- Future Work -->
    <section class="bg-light text-dark p-5 p-lg-0 pt-lg-5 text-center text-sm-start">
        <div class="container p-5">
            <h1 class="py-1">Future Work</h1>
            <p class="lead">
              Given more time and permission to access Chanel's other resources, we would be able to include some of the following 
              features in our app.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Desktop Version</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              One of our outlined 'Should Have' items on the MoSCoW list is the development of a desktop version of our application. 
              Time constraints have prevented us from achieving this in the current project phase. Given additional time, 
              we envision creating a <span class="text-warning">comprehensive desktop interface</span> that mirrors the mobile version's functionalities while enhancing user experience on larger screens. 
              This adaptation would not only extend accessibility but also cater to users preferring desktop over mobile devices.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Privileged Accounts</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Another potential enhancement involves the implementation of privileged accounts, a feature categorized as a 'Could Have' in our project prioritization. 
              With more time, we aim to introduce <span class="text-warning">specialized roles</span> with access to advanced functionalities and sensitive customer details. 
              This would include capabilities such as viewing information of high-importance customers and <span class="text-warning">adjusting order priorities</span>. 
              Such a feature would offer a tailored experience for managing customer relationships and order processing more effectively.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-1">Backup Options</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              Additionally, we recognize the importance of data integrity and the ability to <span class="text-warning">recover from unintended modifications</span>. 
              Incorporating a robust backup and versioning system would empower fashion advisors with the flexibility to revert orders to previous states, 
              ensuring reliability and accuracy in order management. This functionality is crucial for maintaining operational excellence and safeguarding against potential data entry errors.
